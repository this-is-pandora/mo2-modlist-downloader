This is a personal tool of mine used to create and download a collection of mods for TESV: Skyrim SSE.
Developed specifically as a plugin for Mod Organizer 2. 

The idea is to create a 'store' button that, when pressed, will store your currently installed/activated mods into a json file (indexed by priority) 

The other button will read from this json file and download each mod. There is option to set how many mods to download at once to control bandwidth usage. The default option is 4-5 mods at once.

Currently in development.
